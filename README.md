# 5. Clean Code Development 
1.	Readability and Understandability: The code is generally easy to read, with clear function names and variable names.<br> For example:load_books_data(), get_user_favorite_genres(), etc., have clear and descriptive names.<br>
2.	Modularity: Functions are modular, with separate components responsible for specific tasks, such as data loading, preprocessing, and model training.<br>
3.	DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): While most functions adhere to the DRY principle by encapsulating reusable logic, the absence of the recommend_books() function, which could consolidate recommendation logic, might be considered a violation of DRY.<br>
4.	Testing: Unit tests are available in separate files, and showcase a proactive approach toward testing each function's behavior. This strategy aligns with industry best practices, fostering comprehensive validation of the code's functionality when leveraging testing frameworks like pytest or unittest.<br>
[Test files are available here](https://github.com/ayushichawade/Software-Engineering-Project-Book-Recommendation-System-/tree/main/test)  <br>
5.	Consistent Style: The code follows consistent style throughout. <br>
For instance: Indentation is consistent. <br>
Naming conventions are consistent.






# 9. IDE
I worked with Visual Code Studio as an IDE for this project, and integrating it with GitHub enhanced efficiency and productivity.<br> 
1.	Ctrl+F: Find specific words (variables or def name) to edit or review them<br>
2.	Shift + Enter: run the current code <br> 
3.	F5 : start/end debugging <br> 
4.	 Alt+ Up/Down arrow: To move certain pieces of code to different places in the current file.<br> 
5.	Ctrl + Alt+ up/down arrow: when we want to make some edits with multiple lines, it is the efficient way.<br> 
6.	Ctrl + \: Split view / Side-by-side editing, allows you to use split view while editing your files. For me, it was very efficient for creating test files for the code.<br>
7.	Shift + Alt + down/up: copy the lineup or down.<br>
