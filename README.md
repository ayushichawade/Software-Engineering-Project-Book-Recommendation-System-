# 5. Clean Code Development 
•	Readability and Understandability: The code is generally easy to read, with clear function names and variable names. For example:load_books_data(), get_user_favorite_genres(), etc., have clear and descriptive names.





# 9. IDE
I worked with Visual Code Studio as an IDE for this project, and integrating it with GitHub enhanced efficiency and productivity.<br> 
•	Ctrl+F: Find specific words (variables or def name) to edit or review them<br>
•	Shift + Enter: run the current code <br> 
•	F5 : start/end debugging <br> 
•	 Alt+ Up/Down arrow: To move certain pieces of code to different places in the current file.<br> 
•	Ctrl + Alt+ up/down arrow: when we want to make some edits with multiple lines, it is the efficient way.<br> 
•	Ctrl + \: Split view / Side-by-side editing, allows you to use split view while editing your files. For me, it was very efficient for creating test files for the code.<br>
•	Shift + Alt + down/up: copy the lineup or down.<br>
