# 9. IDE
I worked with Visual Code Studio as an IDE for this project, and integrating it with GitHub enhanced efficiency and productivity. 
Ctrl+F: Find specific words (variables or def name) to edit or review them
Shift + Enter: run the current code 
F5 : start/end debugging 
Alt+ Up/Down arrow: To move certain pieces of code to different places in the current file.
Ctrl + Alt+ up/down arrow: when we want to make some edits with multiple lines, it is the efficient way.
Ctrl + \: Split view / Side-by-side editing, allows you to use split view while editing your files. For me, it was very efficient for creating test files for the code.     
Shift + Alt + down/up: copy the line up or down.
