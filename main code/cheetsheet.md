1. Readable and Understandable: Clean code should be easy to read and understand for other developers. This involves clear naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes, as well as well-structured code with appropriate comments and documentation where necessary.

2. Modular and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Clean code is modular, meaning it is organized into logical components that perform specific tasks. It avoids repetition of code by promoting reuse through functions, classes, and libraries.

3. Minimal and Focused: Clean code should be concise and focused on doing one thing well. It avoids unnecessary complexity and "bloat" by removing redundant or unused code and keeping functions and classes small and focused on a single responsibility.

4. Consistent Style: Consistency in coding style throughout the project is crucial for clean code. This includes consistent indentation, spacing, and formatting, as well as adhering to any established style guides or conventions within your development team or community.

5. Error Handling and Robustness: Clean code includes proper error handling to gracefully handle unexpected situations and failures. This ensures that the code is robust and resilient in real-world scenarios.

6. Testable: Clean code is designed to be easily testable, with clear inputs, outputs, and behavior. This involves writing unit tests and integrating testing into the development process to verify that the code functions as expected and remains reliable over time.

7. Performance Considerations: While clean code prioritizes readability and maintainability, it also takes performance into account where necessary. This involves choosing appropriate data structures and algorithms, optimizing critical sections of code, and avoiding unnecessary performance bottlenecks.
